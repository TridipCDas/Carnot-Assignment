The application is running on Heroku.

For this application, I have designed 4 models:
    <ul>
        <li>Books</li>
        <li>Schools</li>
        <li>Students</li>
        <li>ViewedBooks</li>
    </ul>
<i>ViewedBooks model is used for storing the books that a student has read.</i>


The base URL is :: https://carnot-assignment.herokuapp.com/

<ul>
